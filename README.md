# 🔥 **Backpropagation from Scratch in Python**

A lightweight, modular implementation of backpropagation and neural networks in Python, built from the ground up without the use of high-level deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This project demonstrates a clear understanding of the inner workings of neural networks, including forward propagation, backward propagation, and gradient descent optimization.
